# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based sorting visualizer that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by displaying animated bar transitions. The application allows users to choose from multiple algorithms, control the speed, and adjust the number of elements being sorted in real time. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to understand for learners.

## Project Description

The visualizer demonstrates the internal working of six classic sorting algorithms through animated vertical bars. Users can customize the array size and animation speed before running a sort. During the process, the visualizer highlights comparisons and swaps, providing better insight into algorithm behavior.

This tool is ideal for students or anyone looking to intuitively understand how sorting algorithms rearrange data. It runs entirely in the browser and requires no installation.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** ‚Äì For structuring the UI  
- **CSS3** ‚Äì For styling, layout, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** ‚Äì For algorithm logic, DOM manipulation, and animations

There are no external libraries or frameworks used, which keeps the code easy to read and modify for educational purposes.
